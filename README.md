ADVANCED TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING DEEP LEARNING AND ATTENTION MECHANISM

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project implements an advanced time series forecasting system using both traditional statistical modeling and modern deep learning techniques with an attention mechanism. The objective is to compare the performance of a strong baseline forecasting model with a sequence-to-sequence deep learning model incorporating attention, and to analyze the impact of attention on forecasting accuracy and interpretability.

The project demonstrates the ability to handle time series preprocessing, baseline model development, deep learning model construction, evaluation using standard metrics, and interpretation of attention weights.

DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available time series dataset containing monthly airline passenger counts. The data represents a univariate time series with clear trend and seasonality patterns. It is suitable for evaluating both statistical forecasting models and deep learning architectures.

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split to evaluate out-of-sample forecasting performance.

DATA PREPROCESSING

Data preprocessing includes normalization using MinMax scaling to ensure stable neural network training. The time series is converted into supervised learning format by creating input-output sequences using a sliding window approach. Each input sequence contains a fixed number of previous time steps, and the target is the next time step value.

The preprocessing pipeline includes scaling, sequence generation, and splitting into training and testing datasets.

BASELINE MODEL

A Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model is implemented as the baseline forecasting approach. SARIMA is chosen because it effectively models trend and seasonality in time series data.

The baseline model is trained on the training data and used to forecast the test period. Performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

DEEP LEARNING MODEL

The deep learning architecture is built using PyTorch. The model consists of an LSTM layer followed by an attention mechanism and a fully connected output layer.

The LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies in the time series. The attention mechanism assigns importance weights to different time steps in the input sequence, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant historical observations. The context vector generated by the attention layer is passed to a dense layer to produce the final forecast.

MODEL TRAINING

The model is trained using Mean Squared Error loss and the Adam optimizer. Training is performed for a fixed number of epochs. The objective is to minimize prediction error on the training set while generalizing well to the test set.

EVALUATION METRICS

Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Root Mean Squared Error measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.

Mean Absolute Error measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

Both metrics are computed for the baseline model and the LSTM with attention model to enable a direct performance comparison.

RESULTS AND COMPARISON

The results compare SARIMA and the LSTM with attention mechanism on the test dataset. The comparison focuses on forecasting accuracy in terms of RMSE and MAE.

In most cases, the deep learning model with attention demonstrates improved ability to capture complex patterns in the data compared to the traditional statistical baseline.

ATTENTION INTERPRETATION

The attention weights learned by the model are visualized to understand which historical time steps contribute most to each prediction. This improves model interpretability by showing how the network distributes importance across past observations.

The attention mechanism provides insights into temporal dependencies and seasonal behavior in the dataset.
